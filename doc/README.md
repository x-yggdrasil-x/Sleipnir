Phore Core
=====================

Setup
---------------------
[ODIN Core](https://odinblockchain.org/wallet) is the original ODIN client and it builds the backbone of the network. However, it downloads and stores the entire history of ODIN transactions; depending on the speed of your computer and network connection, the synchronization process can take anywhere from a few hours to a day or more. Thankfully you only have to do this once.

Running
---------------------
The following are some helpful notes on how to run ODIN on your native platform.

### Unix

Unpack the files into a directory and run:

- `bin/32/odin-qt` (GUI, 32-bit) or `bin/32/odind` (headless, 32-bit)
- `bin/64/odin-qt` (GUI, 64-bit) or `bin/64/odind` (headless, 64-bit)

### Windows

Unpack the files into a directory, and then run `odin-qt.exe`.

### OSX

Drag ODIN-Qt to your applications folder, and then run `ODIN-Qt`.
